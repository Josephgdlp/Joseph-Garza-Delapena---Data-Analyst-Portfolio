# Joseph-Garza-Delapena - Data-Analyst Portfolio
## About 
Hi, I'm Joseph! I am an aspiring data analyst looking to grow my skills in SQL, Python, visualization tools, Excel, and any other skills to be a successful data analyst. I recently obtained my master's in Information Science from Texas A&M International University. Currently, I am improving my SQL skills, learning a new coding language (Python), and learning visualization tools to better present findings through the IBM, Data Analyst Course offered by Coursera. I'm creating this repository to showcase my projects, track my progress, and hopefully connect with professionals willing to offer any advice.

I am also currently full-time job searching, looking for any entry level analyst roles. I am eager to join an organization looking to take a chance on an aspiring analyst who is willing to learn and soak up all and any information needed to grow throughout an organization!
