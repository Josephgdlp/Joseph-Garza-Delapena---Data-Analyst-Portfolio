## About 
Hi, I'm Joseph! I am an aspiring data analyst looking to grow my skills in SQL, Python, visualization tools, Excel, and any other skills to be a successful data analyst. I recently obtained my master's in Information Science from Texas A&M International University. Currently, I am improving my SQL skills, learning a new coding language (Python), and learning visualization tools to better present findings through the IBM, Data Analyst Course offered by Coursera.
