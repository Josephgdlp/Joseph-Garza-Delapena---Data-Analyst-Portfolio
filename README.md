# Joseph-Garza-Delapena - Data-Analyst Portfolio
## About 
Hi, I'm Joseph! I am an aspiring data analyst looking to grow my skills in SQL, Python, visualization tools, Excel, and any other skills to be a successful data analyst. I recently obtained my master's in Information Science from Texas A&M International University. Currently, I am improving my SQL skills, learning a new coding language (Python), and learning visualization tools to better present findings through the IBM, Data Analyst Course offered by Coursera. I'm creating this repository to showcase my projects, track my progress, and hopefully connect with professionals willing to offer any advice.

I am also currently full-time job searching, looking for any entry level analyst roles. I am eager to join an organization looking to take a chance on an aspiring analyst who is willing to learn and soak up all and any information needed to grow throughout an organization! 

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will be showcasing projects using different tech stacks from either my coursework through Coursera and/or personal passion projects.

#### Description: This project was a final assignment with Coursera that allowed me to gain hands-on experience by drawing insights from the questions asked. I had to download 3 datasets available on the city of Chicago's data portal; Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago, Chicago Public Schools, and Chicago Crime Data. All 3 of these tables were connected to one another through primary and foreign keys. This project involved loading the data, writing queries and subqueries, and answering questions to draw insight from multiple tables. 

#### Results: Use SQL queries to answer questions about the city of Chicago from multiple datasets.
